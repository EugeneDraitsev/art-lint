# Lesson 3: Advanced-Level Spheres

**Objective:** Master the principles of lighting, shading, and overlap by creating a large, complex group of spheres.

**Tools Needed:**
* Pencil
* Paper
* Eraser
* Finger or tissue (for blending)

## Step 1: The Front Row
Start by drawing a horizontal row of 5-7 spheres.
* Make them roughly the same size.
* Have them touch each other.

## Step 2: The Second Row
Draw a second row of spheres behind the first one.
* Place them in the "valleys" between the spheres in the front row.
* Remember to "tuck" them (stop your line at the front sphere's edge).
* Draw them slightly higher on the paper.

## Step 3: Build the Pyramid
Continue adding rows, each one having fewer spheres than the one in front of it, until you have a large pyramid or pile of spheres.

* Add a third row, then a fourth, etc.
* Don't forget the horizon line in the background!

## Step 4: The Master Light Source
Place your light source in the **top right**. Now, you must be consistent.
* Every single sphere must have its highlight on the top right.
* Every single sphere must have its darkest shading on the bottom left.
* Add the cast shadows on the ground.

## Step 5: The "Nook and Cranny" Shadows
This is the most important step for realism. Add deep, dark shadows wherever two spheres touch or overlap.
* These shadows are darker than the core shadow on the spheres themselves.
* They separate the objects and make the pile look solid.
* Blend everything smoothly.

**Result:** A massive, realistic pile of spheres that looks like you could reach in and grab one!
