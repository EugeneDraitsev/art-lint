# Lesson 4: The Cube

**Objective:** Learn to draw a three-dimensional cube and understand how light interacts with flat surfaces.

**Key Concept:** Unlike a sphere which has a smooth gradient, a cube's faces will have distinct, solid tones.

## Step 1: The Front Face
Draw a simple square in the middle of your page. This will be the front face of your cube.

## Step 2: The Top and Side Edges
We'll draw this in "one-point perspective".
1.  From the top-left corner of your square, draw a short diagonal line going up and to the left.
2.  From the top-right corner, draw a similar diagonal line.
3.  From the bottom-right corner, draw a third diagonal line.
4.  **Important:** All three diagonal lines must be parallel to each other.

## Step 3: Completing the Shape
Now, connect the ends of those diagonal lines.
1.  Draw a horizontal line to connect the two top lines. This makes the top face.
2.  Draw a vertical line to connect the top-right and bottom-right lines. This makes the side face.

You now have a transparent cube!

## Step 4: Light Source and Cast Shadow
Let's place the light source in the **top right** again.
* The shadow will be cast on the ground to the **bottom left**.
* The shadow for a cube is angular, not oval like a sphere's.

## Step 5: Shading the Faces
Since the surfaces are flat, each face will have one solid tone.
1.  **Top Face:** This is facing the light most directly. Leave it **white** or shade it very lightly.
2.  **Front Face:** This is facing away from the light, but not completely. Shade it with a **medium** gray tone.
3.  **Right Side Face:** This is facing completely away from the light. Shade it with your **darkest** tone.

**Result:** A solid, three-dimensional cube with defined planes!
