# Lesson 2: Overlapping Spheres

**Objective:** Create the illusion of depth by drawing one object "in front" of another.

**Key Concept:** Objects that are closer to you appear **lower** on the paper and **overlap** the objects behind them.

## Step 1: The First Sphere
Draw your first sphere just like in Lesson 1. This will be the "front" sphere.
* Draw the circle.
* Determine your light source (Top Right).

## Step 2: The Second Sphere (Tucking)
Draw a second circle, but place it slightly **higher** on the page and "tuck" it behind the first one.

* Imagine the first sphere is blocking part of the second sphere.
* **Do not** draw the line through the first sphere. Stop your pencil when you hit the edge of the first circle, jump over it, and continue on the other side.

## Step 3: The Horizon Line
To keep our spheres from floating in outer space, draw a horizontal line behind them.
* Draw a straight line across the page behind the spheres.
* Skip over the spheres (don't draw through them).
* This creates a background (wall/sky) and a foreground (table/floor).

## Step 4: Shading the Nook
This is the secret sauce of separation. You need to define where the spheres touch.

* Add a dark shadow on the back sphere, right where it tucks behind the front sphere. This is called a "nook and cranny" shadow.
* It pushes the back sphere deeper into the background.

## Step 5: Cast Shadows and Blending
Just like Lesson 1, add your cast shadows on the ground.
1.  Since light is top-right, cast shadows go **bottom-left**.
2.  The back sphere's shadow will be slightly higher up the page than the front sphere's shadow.
3.  Blend everything with your finger to make it look smooth.

**Result:** You now have two spheres existing in 3D space!
