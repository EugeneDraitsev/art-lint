# Lesson 5: The Cylinder

**Objective:** Combine the curved lines of a sphere with the vertical lines of a cube to create cans, towers, and cups.

**Key Concept:** "The Curve." The bottom of a cylinder is never a straight line; it must match the curve of the top!

## Step 1: The Ellipse (The Squashed Circle)
Draw a flattened circle (an oval) in the center of your page. This is called an **Ellipse**.
* This represents the flat top of your cylinder (like the top of a soda can).
* Keep it nice and narrow.

## Step 2: The Walls
Draw two vertical lines coming down from the edges of your ellipse.
* Start at the widest part of the oval on the left and draw straight down.
* Do the same on the right.
* Make sure the lines are the same length!

## Step 3: The Curved Bottom (The Smile)
This is where most beginners make a mistake! **Do not** connect the bottom with a straight line.
* Draw a curved line connecting the bottom of the two walls.
* This curve should look like a "smile."
* It should match the curve of the bottom edge of your top oval.

## Step 4: The Light Source
Let's keep our "sun" in the **top right**.
* Since the object is round, the shading will wrap around it.
* The right side of the cylinder will be bright (facing the sun).
* The left side will be in shadow (turning away).
* Draw a vertical "Core Shadow" strip on the left side, but leave a tiny sliver of reflected light on the very edge.

## Step 5: The Cast Shadow and The Lid
Finishing touches:
1.  **Cast Shadow:** Draw a shadow stretching out to the **bottom left**. It should start at the curved bottom of the can.
2.  **The Top:** Since the light is high up, the top of the can is the brightest spot. Leave it pure white!

**Result:** You have mastered the three fundamental blocks of drawing: The Sphere, The Cube, and The Cylinder!
