# Lesson 1: The Sphere

**Objective:** Learn how to turn a flat, two-dimensional circle into a three-dimensional sphere using a light source and shading.

**Tools Needed:**
* Pencil
* Paper
* Eraser
* Finger or tissue (for blending)

## Step 1: The Circle
Draw a simple circle in the middle of your page. Don't worry if it isn't perfect; a "lumpy" circle makes for a more organic shape (like a potato or a rock).

> **Tip:** Draw lightly at first. You can always darken the lines later.

## Step 2: The Light Source
Decide where your "sun" is. For this lesson, let's place the light source in the **top right corner**.

Draw a tiny sun or an arrow at the top right of your page to remind you where the light is coming from. This is the most important step in 3D drawing!

## Step 3: The Cast Shadow
If the light is coming from the top right, the shadow will appear on the ground on the **bottom left** (opposite the light).

Draw a horizontal oval shape tucked under the bottom left of the circle. This anchors your object to the ground so it doesn't look like it's floating.

## Step 4: Shading (The Core Shadow)
Now, we shade the object itself. Since the light is on the top right, the darkest part of the sphere will be on the **bottom left**, just before the edge.

1.  Start scribbling lightly on the curve of the circle opposite the light.
2.  Get darker as you move away from the light source.
3.  Leave the spot facing the sun pure white (this is the **Highlight**).

## Step 5: Blending
Use your finger or a tissue to smudge your pencil shading.
* Rub the graphite from the dark area toward the light area.
* Smooth out the cast shadow on the ground.

**Result:** You have transformed a 2D circle into a 3D Sphere!
