# Lesson 1: The Sphere

**Objective:** Learn how to turn a flat, two-dimensional circle into a three-dimensional sphere using a light source and shading.

**Tools Needed:**
* Pencil
* Paper
* Eraser
* Finger or tissue (for blending)

## Step 1: The Circle
Draw a simple circle in the middle of your page. Don't worry if it isn't perfect; a "lumpy" circle makes for a more organic shape (like a potato or a rock).

> **Tip:** Draw lightly at first. You can always darken the lines later.

## Step 2: The Light Source
Decide where your "sun" is. For this lesson, let's place the light source in the **top right corner**.

Draw a tiny sun or an arrow at the top right of your page to remind you where the light is coming from. This is the most important step in 3D drawing!

## Step 3: The Cast Shadow
If the light is coming from the top right, the shadow will appear on the ground on the **bottom left** (opposite the light).

Draw a horizontal oval shape tucked under the bottom left of the circle. This anchors your object to the ground so it doesn't look like it's floating.

---

## Step 4: Shading (The Core Shadow)
Now, we shade the object itself. Since the light is on the top right, the darkest part of the sphere will be on the **bottom left**, just before the edge.

1.  Start scribbling lightly on the curve of the circle opposite the light.
2.  Get darker as you move away from the light source.
3.  Leave the spot facing the sun pure white (this is the **Highlight**).

---

## Step 5: Blending
Use your finger or a tissue to smudge your pencil shading.
* Rub the graphite from the dark area toward the light area.
* Smooth out the cast shadow on the ground.

**Result:** You have transformed a 2D circle into a 3D Sphere!

# Lesson 2: Overlapping Spheres

The human brain loves clues. The biggest clue for depth is **Overlap**. If Object A is blocking Object B, Object A must be closer.

![Diagram: Overlap creates depth vs flat shapes](internal:overlap)

## The Rules of Depth
1.  **Overlap**: Objects in front partially hide objects behind.
2.  **Placement**: Objects closer to you are lower on the paper.
3.  **Size**: Objects closer to you appear larger.

## Your Mission
Draw a "cloud" of spheres. Start with one in the center. Tuck the next one behind it. Keep going until you have 10-15 spheres floating together.

# Lesson 3: Advanced Spheres

Now that you can draw one sphere, let's draw fifty. This lesson focuses on **density** and **perspective grid**.

![Diagram: Perspective Grid and Density](internal:density)

## The Grid
Imagine a flat surface receding into the distance. 
*   Spheres in the foreground are **huge** and have high contrast.
*   Spheres in the background are **tiny**, lighter in value, and clustered closely together.

## Your Mission
Draw a "carpet" of spheres. Make them look like they are rolling away from you towards a horizon line. Use the size difference to sell the illusion.

# Lesson 4: The Cube

The cube is the building block of all man-made structures. If you can draw a cube, you can draw a house, a car, or a table.

![Diagram: The Y-Method Construction](internal:cube)

## The "Y" Method
1.  Draw a vertical line (the near corner).
2.  Draw a 'V' shape from the top.
3.  Draw an inverted 'V' from the bottom.
4.  Connect the lines to form the sides.

## Your Mission
Draw 5 floating cubes. Rotate them slightly. Shade the bottom of each cube darker than the sides to show they are floating.

# Lesson 5: Hollow Cubes

Real boxes aren't made of paper-thin lines. They have **thickness**.

![Diagram: Drawing Hollow Objects with Thickness](internal:hollow)

## The Offset Technique
To show a hollow object, you need to draw the **Inner Edge**.
1.  Draw a standard cube.
2.  Draw a smaller square on the front face.
3.  From the corners of that inner square, draw angled lines going *into* the box.
4.  **Shade the inside**. The inside of a box receives less light than the outside.

## Your Mission
Draw a cereal box that is open at the top. Show the thickness of the cardboard flaps.
