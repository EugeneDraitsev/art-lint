# Lesson 1: The Sphere

**Objective:** Learn how to turn a flat, two-dimensional circle into a three-dimensional sphere using a light source and shading.

**Tools Needed:**
* Pencil
* Paper
* Eraser
* Finger or tissue (for blending)

---

## Step 1: The Circle
Draw a simple circle in the middle of your page. Don't worry if it isn't perfect; a "lumpy" circle makes for a more organic shape (like a potato or a rock).

> **Tip:** Draw lightly at first. You can always darken the lines later.

---

## Step 2: The Light Source
Decide where your "sun" is. For this lesson, let's place the light source in the **top right corner**.

Draw a tiny sun or an arrow at the top right of your page to remind you where the light is coming from. This is the most important step in 3D drawing!

---

## Step 3: The Cast Shadow
If the light is coming from the top right, the shadow will appear on the ground on the **bottom left** (opposite the light).

Draw a horizontal oval shape tucked under the bottom left of the circle. This anchors your object to the ground so it doesn't look like it's floating.

![Image: The circle with a squashed oval shadow stretching out to the bottom left.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EugeneDraitsev/art-lint/refs/heads/content/content/beginner-shapes/the-sphere/the-sphere-3.jpg)
---

## Step 4: Shading (The Core Shadow)
Now, we shade the object itself. Since the light is on the top right, the darkest part of the sphere will be on the **bottom left**, just before the edge.

1.  Start scribbling lightly on the curve of the circle opposite the light.
2.  Get darker as you move away from the light source.
3.  Leave the spot facing the sun pure white (this is the **Highlight**).

![Image: The circle is now shaded. It is dark on the bottom left and fades to white on the top right.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EugeneDraitsev/art-lint/refs/heads/content/content/beginner-shapes/the-sphere/the-sphere-4.jpg)
---

## Step 5: Blending
Use your finger or a tissue to smudge your pencil shading.
* Rub the graphite from the dark area toward the light area.
* Smooth out the cast shadow on the ground.

**Result:** You have transformed a 2D circle into a 3D Sphere!

  overlapping: `
# Lesson 2: Overlapping Spheres

**Objective:** Create the illusion of depth by drawing one object "in front" of another.

**Key Concept:** Objects that are closer to you appear **lower** on the paper and **overlap** the objects behind them.

---

## Step 1: The First Sphere
Draw your first sphere just like in Lesson 1. This will be the "front" sphere.
* Draw the circle.
* Determine your light source (Top Right).

![Image: A single circle drawn near the bottom center of the page.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EugeneDraitsev/art-lint/refs/heads/content/content/beginner-shapes/overlapping-spheres/1.jpg)

---

## Step 2: The Second Sphere (Tucking)
Draw a second circle, but place it slightly **higher** on the page and "tuck" it behind the first one.

* Imagine the first sphere is blocking part of the second sphere.
* **Do not** draw the line through the first sphere. Stop your pencil when you hit the edge of the first circle, jump over it, and continue on the other side.

![Image: Two circles. The one on the left is slightly higher and appears to be peeking out from behind the front one.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EugeneDraitsev/art-lint/refs/heads/content/content/beginner-shapes/overlapping-spheres/2.jpg)

---

## Step 3: The Horizon Line
To keep our spheres from floating in outer space, draw a horizontal line behind them.
* Draw a straight line across the page behind the spheres.
* Skip over the spheres (don't draw through them).
* This creates a background (wall/sky) and a foreground (table/floor).

![Image: The two circles now have a horizontal line running behind them, creating a 'floor'.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EugeneDraitsev/art-lint/refs/heads/content/content/beginner-shapes/overlapping-spheres/3.jpg)

---

## Step 4: Shading the Nook
This is the secret sauce of separation. You need to define where the spheres touch.

* Add a dark shadow on the back sphere, right where it tucks behind the front sphere. This is called a "nook and cranny" shadow.
* It pushes the back sphere deeper into the background.

![Image: Close up of the intersection between the two spheres. The back sphere has a dark shadow right along the edge of the front sphere.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EugeneDraitsev/art-lint/refs/heads/content/content/beginner-shapes/overlapping-spheres/4.jpg)

---

## Step 5: Cast Shadows and Blending
Just like Lesson 1, add your cast shadows on the ground.
1.  Since light is top-right, cast shadows go **bottom-left**.
2.  The back sphere's shadow will be slightly higher up the page than the front sphere's shadow.
3.  Blend everything with your finger to make it look smooth.

**Result:** You now have two spheres existing in 3D space!

![Image: Two finished 3D spheres. The front one is bright; the back one is shaded darker where they touch. Both cast shadows on the ground.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EugeneDraitsev/art-lint/refs/heads/content/content/beginner-shapes/overlapping-spheres/5.jpg)`,

  advancedSpheres: `
# Lesson 3: Advanced-Level Spheres

**Objective:** Master the principles of lighting, shading, and overlap by creating a large, complex group of spheres.

**Tools Needed:**
* Pencil
* Paper
* Eraser
* Finger or tissue (for blending)

---

## Step 1: The Front Row
Start by drawing a horizontal row of 5-7 spheres.
* Make them roughly the same size.
* Have them touch each other.

![Image: A single horizontal row of five circles, all touching side-by-side.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EugeneDraitsev/art-lint/refs/heads/content/content/beginner-shapes/advanced-level-spheres/1.jpg)

---

## Step 2: The Second Row
Draw a second row of spheres behind the first one.
* Place them in the "valleys" between the spheres in the front row.
* Remember to "tuck" them (stop your line at the front sphere's edge).
* Draw them slightly higher on the paper.

![Image: A second row of four circles is drawn behind the first row, tucked into the spaces between the front circles.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EugeneDraitsev/art-lint/refs/heads/content/content/beginner-shapes/advanced-level-spheres/2.jpg)

---

## Step 3: Build the Pyramid
Continue adding rows, each one having fewer spheres than the one in front of it, until you have a large pyramid or pile of spheres.

* Add a third row, then a fourth, etc.
* Don't forget the horizon line in the background!

![Image: A large pyramid shape made of many overlapping circles. A horizon line runs behind the entire group.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EugeneDraitsev/art-lint/refs/heads/content/content/beginner-shapes/advanced-level-spheres/3.jpg)

---

## Step 4: The Master Light Source
Place your light source in the **top right**. Now, you must be consistent.
* Every single sphere must have its highlight on the top right.
* Every single sphere must have its darkest shading on the bottom left.
* Add the cast shadows on the ground.

![Image: The pyramid of circles. A sun is in the top right. All circles have highlights on the top right and dark shading on the bottom left.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EugeneDraitsev/art-lint/refs/heads/content/content/beginner-shapes/advanced-level-spheres/4.jpg)

---

## Step 5: The "Nook and Cranny" Shadows
This is the most important step for realism. Add deep, dark shadows wherever two spheres touch or overlap.
* These shadows are darker than the core shadow on the spheres themselves.
* They separate the objects and make the pile look solid.
* Blend everything smoothly.

**Result:** A massive, realistic pile of spheres that looks like you could reach in and grab one!

![Image: A fully rendered pile of 3D spheres. The shading is smooth, cast shadows are on the ground, and very dark, defined shadows are in all the spaces where spheres touch.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EugeneDraitsev/art-lint/refs/heads/content/content/beginner-shapes/advanced-level-spheres/5.jpg)`,

  cube: `
# Lesson 4: The Cube

**Objective:** Learn to draw a three-dimensional cube and understand how light interacts with flat surfaces.

**Key Concept:** Unlike a sphere which has a smooth gradient, a cube's faces will have distinct, solid tones.

---

## Step 1: The Front Face
Draw a simple square in the middle of your page. This will be the front face of your cube.

![Image: A simple, cleanly drawn square in the center of the page.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EugeneDraitsev/art-lint/refs/heads/content/content/beginner-shapes/the-cube/1.jpg)

---

## Step 2: The Top and Side Edges
We'll draw this in "one-point perspective".
1.  From the top-left corner of your square, draw a short diagonal line going up and to the left.
2.  From the top-right corner, draw a similar diagonal line.
3.  From the bottom-right corner, draw a third diagonal line.
4.  **Important:** All three diagonal lines must be parallel to each other.

![Image: The square from Step 1, now with three diagonal lines extending from its top-left, top-right, and bottom-right corners.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EugeneDraitsev/art-lint/refs/heads/content/content/beginner-shapes/the-cube/2.jpg)

---

## Step 3: Completing the Shape
Now, connect the ends of those diagonal lines.
1.  Draw a horizontal line to connect the two top lines. This makes the top face.
2.  Draw a vertical line to connect the top-right and bottom-right lines. This makes the side face.

You now have a transparent cube!

![Image: A completed 3D cube drawing, showing the front, top, and right side faces.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EugeneDraitsev/art-lint/refs/heads/content/content/beginner-shapes/the-cube/3.jpg)

---

## Step 4: Light Source and Cast Shadow
Let's place the light source in the **top right** again.
* The shadow will be cast on the ground to the **bottom left**.
* The shadow for a cube is angular, not oval like a sphere's.

![Image: The cube with a sun icon in the top right. An angular cast shadow is on the ground to the bottom left of the cube.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EugeneDraitsev/art-lint/refs/heads/content/content/beginner-shapes/the-cube/4.jpg)

---

## Step 5: Shading the Faces
Since the surfaces are flat, each face will have one solid tone.
1.  **Top Face:** This is facing the light most directly. Leave it **white** or shade it very lightly.
2.  **Front Face:** This is facing away from the light, but not completely. Shade it with a **medium** gray tone.
3.  **Right Side Face:** This is facing completely away from the light. Shade it with your **darkest** tone.

**Result:** A solid, three-dimensional cube with defined planes!

![Image: A fully rendered 3D cube. The top face is bright white, the front face is a medium gray, and the right face is dark gray. It has a cast shadow on the ground.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EugeneDraitsev/art-lint/refs/heads/content/content/beginner-shapes/the-cube/5.jpg)`,

  cylinder: `
# Lesson 5: The Cylinder

**Objective:** Combine the curved lines of a sphere with the vertical lines of a cube to create cans, towers, and cups.

**Key Concept:** "The Curve." The bottom of a cylinder is never a straight line; it must match the curve of the top!

---

## Step 1: The Ellipse (The Squashed Circle)
Draw a flattened circle (an oval) in the center of your page. This is called an **Ellipse**.
* This represents the flat top of your cylinder (like the top of a soda can).
* Keep it nice and narrow.

![Image: A clean, horizontal oval (ellipse) drawn in the center of the page.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EugeneDraitsev/art-lint/refs/heads/content/content/beginner-shapes/the-cylinder/1.jpg)

---

## Step 2: The Walls
Draw two vertical lines coming down from the edges of your ellipse.
* Start at the widest part of the oval on the left and draw straight down.
* Do the same on the right.
* Make sure the lines are the same length!

![Image: The oval from step 1, now with two vertical lines extending downward from its left and right edges.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EugeneDraitsev/art-lint/refs/heads/content/content/beginner-shapes/the-cylinder/2.jpg)

---

## Step 3: The Curved Bottom (The Smile)
This is where most beginners make a mistake! **Do not** connect the bottom with a straight line.
* Draw a curved line connecting the bottom of the two walls.
* This curve should look like a "smile."
* It should match the curve of the bottom edge of your top oval.

![Image: The shape is closed at the bottom with a curved line that mimics the curve of the top oval. It now looks like a tin can.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EugeneDraitsev/art-lint/refs/heads/content/content/beginner-shapes/the-cylinder/3.jpg)

---

## Step 4: The Light Source
Let's keep our "sun" in the **top right**.
* Since the object is round, the shading will wrap around it.
* The right side of the cylinder will be bright (facing the sun).
* The left side will be in shadow (turning away).
* Draw a vertical "Core Shadow" strip on the left side, but leave a tiny sliver of reflected light on the very edge.

![Image: The cylinder with a sun in the top right. The cylinder is shaded with a vertical gradient: dark on the left, fading to white on the right.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EugeneDraitsev/art-lint/refs/heads/content/content/beginner-shapes/the-cylinder/4.jpg)

---

## Step 5: The Cast Shadow and The Lid
Finishing touches:
1.  **Cast Shadow:** Draw a shadow stretching out to the **bottom left**. It should start at the curved bottom of the can.
2.  **The Top:** Since the light is high up, the top of the can is the brightest spot. Leave it pure white!

**Result:** You have mastered the three fundamental blocks of drawing: The Sphere, The Cube, and The Cylinder!
